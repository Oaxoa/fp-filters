# Contributing

What is appreciated? Anything.

Especially:

1. 💡 Ideas for new functions. They must fall in a semantic group (even a new) and be generic enough to help as many devs
   out there.
   Did you noticed the same filter function over and over again in your codebase?
   Then you probably have a good candidate for a new function.
2. 🐞 Help with spotting bugs (and fix them)
3. ✏️ Help with Typescript and get rid of the untyped or the unknowns
4. 📄 Help with documentation
5. ❤️ Support of any kind (yes, emotional too).
6. ⭐️ If you like this project, please star it.
