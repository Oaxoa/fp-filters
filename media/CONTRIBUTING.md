# Contributing

What is appreciated? Anything.

Especially:

1. Ideas for new functions. They must fall in a semantic group (even a new) and be generic enough to help as many devs
   out there.
   Did you noticed the same filter function over and over again in your codebase?
   Then you probably have a good candidate for a new function.
2. Help with spotting bugs (and fix them)
3. Help with Typescript and get rid of the untyped or the unknowns
4. Help with documentation
5. Support of any kind (yes, emotional too 😁).
6. If you like this project, please star it ⭐️
